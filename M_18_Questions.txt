Question 1.)
To build a recommendation system for student loan options, 
you would need to collect a variety of data that encompasses 
both the characteristics of the loans and the profiles of the 
students. Specifically, the data should include:

Loan Details: Interest rates, repayment terms, loan amounts, 
fees, eligibility criteria, lender information, and customer reviews. 
This information helps assess the financial aspects of each loan option.

Student Profiles: Financial situation (income, employment status), 
educational background (degree, institution), career goals, credit history, 
and borrowing history. Understanding the student's profile helps match them 
with the most appropriate loan options.

Market Data: General economic indicators, average loan amounts, 
interest rates, default rates, and graduation rates. This data 
provides context for the loan options and student circumstances.

Question 2.)

Given the nature of the data and the objective of the 
recommendation system, a content-based filtering method 
would be most suitable. This method uses detailed information 
about the loan options and student profiles to recommend loans 
that closely match the student's needs and qualifications.

Content-based filtering works well in this scenario because 
it can utilize the specific attributes of loans and students to 
make personalized recommendations. Unlike collaborative filtering, 
it does not rely on other users' behaviors, which is beneficial 
since loan choices are highly individualized and based on personal 
financial situations and goals.

Question 3.)

Data Privacy and Security: Student financial and personal 
data are sensitive. Ensuring the privacy and security of this 
data is paramount. Failing to do so could lead to legal issues 
and loss of trust.

Regulatory Compliance: Financial products, including student 
loans, are heavily regulated. The recommendation system must 
comply with all applicable laws and regulations, which can vary 
0significantly by region.
